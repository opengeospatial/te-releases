TEAM Engine Releases in the OGC Validation Websites
========================================================

This repository tracks the releases of executable test suites at the OGC TEAM Engine [production](http://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine)  and [beta](http://cite.opengeospatial.org/te2) validator websites.

An issue is created every time there is a change in a test that needs to be deployed in the OGC validator web sites. More about the release process [here](https://github.com/opengeospatial/cite/wiki/Releasing-Tests-to-the-OGC-Testing-Infrastructure).

TEAM Engine can be downloaded and installed in your local environment. Follow the instructions at the [TEAM Engine repository](https://github.com/opengeospatial/teamengine).

Docker images of the production and beta validators are also available on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/u/ogccite).
